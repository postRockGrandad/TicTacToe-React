# Monese-Task
Repo for Monese assessment task - create Tic Tac Toe with functioning scoreboard using React Hooks.

To run the application:
1. clone the repo / download as zip and extract
2. from inside the working directory (tic-tac-toe), run `npm ci` from a terminal
  1. `ci` instead of `install` as it works off package-lock.json and will install the identical versions of all deps that were used for the most recent successful build (avoids potential semver issues)
3. run `npm start` from the same terminal once the `ci` finishes
4. navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the running application
